# The butterfly

It happened a few years ago. Such a sunny day it was. While I was looking through the window, a black butterfly landed in such a soft and delicate manner. The day was so pretty that I couldn't get it. I was forced to stay in, but it chose to be there. Hiding from happiness, could it be?
