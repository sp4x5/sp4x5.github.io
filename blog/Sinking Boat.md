# The Sinking Boat

The year was 2011. My dear self dreamt becoming a programmer. At this moment I've got my first personal computer, it wasn't my family's computer, it was mine. I chose a Mac, more precisely an entry-level iMac 2011, and I couldn't be happier. Mac OS X Lion was a beast of an OS, the hardware as just right, and I was just a kid without any guiding.

My judge on what makes a platform great resounds on quality, stability, intuitiveness, and coverability. Quality is related directly to the hardware, a good screen, fast SSD, fast typing keyboard (and I do love the butterfly mechanism). Stability includes both software and hardware. Intuitiveness is related to the amount of time is required to master the basics of something. Coverability is the ratio between things you do and things you can do on your machine.

When considering those points, three factors are relevant:
- Hardware affects quality and stability.
- Software affects stability and intuitiveness.
- The user affects intuitiveness and coverability.

Hardware and software have changed. But my 2011 self still tries to survive in such a different world. It's now easy to see that the sinking boat it's me.
